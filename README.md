# HOW TO RUN

The most important thing for running is to make sure that you have node installed, otherwise this will not be able to run at all. Once you install node (or if you already had node installed), use the cd command in your terminal to make sure you're in the directory that has all these files and folders (data, webapp, index.js, etc.). Once you're in the directory, use the command "node index.js" if it worked, "listening on port 3000" should appear in the terminal. From there, all you have to do is open your web browser and go to the address "localhost:3000" and then that's it!
