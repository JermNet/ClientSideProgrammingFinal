    <h4>
        Welcome to our little book store! We haven't much to be perfectly honest but what we do have is absolutely wonderful! Take a look at our wonderful selection of books! We have many great books listed below or maybe none at all! Why the vagueness? That's because this is not a website but a web app! There could be 5 books or 67 or 1, this website will adjust for those books! Because of this (totally one of a kind) technology, books are added in a snap! Things couldn't be easier (for the user anyway!)! So glance around and look for a book that piques your interest! If it really interests you, give it a buy (that is, if it's in stock, of course).

    <!--This is used to have expandable sections with CSS and JavaScript magic! The biggest things of note here are that there is an expandable content wrapper class and an expandable content class. That's just because things go a little off without both. The other is that I'm using an icon from ionicons (though, they're not seen here since they're added with the JavaScript)! I thought it looked cool when searching around for things so here it makes its appearance. Also, side note: I could have had all of these in an omega div and had it added through the script, but I like this way better; to me, it makes more sense to only have what's needed using the script be added using it.-->

        <!--Extra class for query selectors with JS. This is mostly, so I can use the same JS with both HTML files. In a bigger web app with more pages, I would use separate JS files but for something on this scale, this is reasonable.-->
